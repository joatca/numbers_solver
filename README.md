Solver for the Numbers game

Note: this is a Flutter project so source code is in lib/

The Numbers Solver finds solutions for the "Numbers" game (as played on long-running game shows in the UK, France and Australia). Note that it doesn't let you *play* the numbers game, it just finds the best solutions.

Written as a simple first [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) app; I already had a [Crystal version](https://github.com/joatca/numbers) so it was easy to port the algorithm to Dart then focus on playing with the framework.

Also see the [app page](https://apps.joat.me/page/numbers/) for more information.
